Use UInt128 = up to 3,4028236692×10³⁸
So - optimal number length is [0 ... 37] (between 2**126 and 2**127)

Max is UInt128, so p and q is UInt64 = ≤19 number length.
It's the easiest way but BigNum is doable enough.
Proceed doing it this way then make BigNum type that conforms to <T>IntegerType with all funcs that will be needed.
